# Corregidor Services (Backend Infrastructure)

## WTH Is This??

This project provides the backend functionality for the forms that exist on the client-side application for my Corregidor Services site.  That site isn't complete, but you can check out the code on GitHub via the link below:

This project provides the code for handling the contact form data, as well as the Entity Framework to support the data interaction with the SQL Server database (that currently exists locally on my machine, but will be eventually deployed to Azure).

## Steps Completed

So far, the domain model as well as the public interface resource have been created.  Also, I used Entity Framework to build the SQL Server database. 

## Note to Self: What to Do Next

I created the controller class and mapped the domain class to the public inerface class, but the controller doesn't yet have functionality.  So, that's the next step: add POST functionality to the controller.  


## Interesting (to me only, probably)

This is my first time building a .NET project via VS Code and the Command Line instead of Visual Studio.  I sorta dig it.
